## Duration
2 hours

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the purpose of exploratory data analysis
2. Identify data quality issues
3. Describe patterns, trends, and anomalies in data
4. Ask meaningful questions based on data observations

---

## Lesson Flow

### 1. Introduction (15 mins)
- What is EDA?
- Why we explore before modelling
- Examples of poor decisions caused by bad data understanding

---

### 2. Key Concepts (30 mins)
- Data types (categorical vs numerical)
- Missing values and outliers
- Summary statistics (mean, median, range)

---

### 3. Guided Activity (40 mins)
Students are given a small dataset and asked to:
- Identify variables
- Spot obvious issues
- Describe one interesting pattern

Focus is on **interpretation**, not tools.

---

### 4. Discussion (20 mins)
- What surprised you?
- What assumptions might be wrong?
- What additional data would you want?

---

### 5. Reflection (15 mins)
Students write a short paragraph:
> “What story does this data *seem* to tell, and what could be misleading?”

---

## Assessment (Formative)
- Participation in discussion
- Quality of observations and reasoning
